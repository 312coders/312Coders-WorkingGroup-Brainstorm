# 312Coders-WorkingGroup-Brainstorm

This is a space for us to come together and generate new ideas for working groups and projects. *All ideas are welcome*, so feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions - your contributions are always valued. 

**How to Contribute:**

1. **Create a new issue or project:** If you have a new idea for a working group or project, create a new issue and provide a detailed description. See below for my information on setting up a GitHub Project
3. **Create or join existing discussions:** Create a new discussion to brainstorm or request feedback for an idea. Or participate in ongoing discussions by adding comments and suggestions. 


# Using GitHub Projects for Brainstorming Working Groups

- Click the **Projects** tab, then **New project**.

## 2. Set Up Your Project
- **Name**: Give it a descriptive name
- **Template**: Choose a template
- **Customize**: Add columns, labels, and milestones as needed.

## 3. Add Issues and Cards
- **Create Issues**: For each idea or topic.
- **Convert to Cards**: Drag issues to the project board.
- **Label & Organize**: Categorize cards by status or topic and move them between columns.

## 4. Track Progress & Collaborate
- **Milestones**: Set milestones for key goals.
- **Assign Tasks**: Delegate responsibilities to team members.
- **Comments**: Discuss and provide feedback directly on cards.

### Example Setup:
